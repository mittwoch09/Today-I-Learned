# Summary of the book "Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster"

## PART ONE: STOP LYING TO YOURSELF

### CHAPTER 1 - We're All Liars
- Entrepreneurs are particularly good at lying to themselves. Lying may even be a prerequisite for succeeding as an entrepreneur.
- Analytics is the necessary counterweight to lying.
- Morevoer, data-driven learning is the cornerstone of success in startups.
- *Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.*
- Lean Startup provides a framework by which you can more rigorously go about the business of creating something new.
- CASE STUDY : Airbnb Phothography - Growth Within Growth
    - Aribnb's team had a hunch that better photos would increase rentals.
    - They tested the idea with a Concierge MVP(Minimum Viable Product), putting the least effort possible into a test that would give them valid results.
    - When the experiment showed good results, they bulit the necessary components and rolled it out to all customers.
- When you think you've found a worthwhile idea, decide how to test it quickly, with minimal investment.
- Lean, analytical thinking is about asking the right questions, and focusing on the one key metric that will produce the change you're after.

### CHAPTER 2 - How to Keep Score
- What Makes a Good Metric?
    - A good metric is comparative.
    - A good metric is understandable.
    - A good metric is a ratio or a rate 
        - Ratios are easier to act on.
        - Ratios are inherently comparative.
        - Ratios also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there's an inherent tension.
    - A good metric changes the way you behave.
- Metrics often come in pairs.
    - *Conversion rate* (the percentage of people who buy something) is tied to *time-to-purchase*(how long it takes someone to buy something). Together, they tell you a lot about your cash flow.
    - *viral coefficient*(the number of people a user successfully invites to your service) and *viral cycle*(how long it takes them to invite others) drive your adoption rate.
- Analysts look at specific metrics that drive the business, called *Key Performance Indicators* (KPIs).
    - Qualitative vs Quantitative Metrics
        - Quantitiative data is easy to understnad. It's the numbers we track and measure-for example, sports scores and movie ratings.
        - Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It's the stuff of interviews and debates.
    - Vanity vs Real Metrics
        - Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, "What will I do differently based on this information?"
        - Consider, for example, "total signups." This is a vanity metric. It tells us nothing about what those users are doing or whether they're valuable to us.
        - The real metric of interes-the *actionable* one-is "percent of users who are active." This is a critical metric because it tells us about the level of engagement your users have with your product.
    - Exploratory vs Reporting Metrics
    
    - Leading vs Lagging Metrics
        - Leading metrics give you a predictive understanding of the future; lagging metrics explain the past.
    - Correlated vs Casual Metrics
        - If two metrics change together, they're correlated, but if one metric causes another metric to change, they're causal.
