    "As you might expect, a binary outcome experiment has only two outcomes: either an action is taken or it isn’t. Either a user completes a registration flow or they don’t. A consumer clicks on a website ad or they don’t. A student graduates or they don’t. For these types of experiments, we calculate the proportion of each variant that completes the action. The numerator is the number of completers, while the denominator is all units that were exposed. This metric is also described as a rate: completion rate, click-through rate, graduation rate, and so on.\n",

    "To determine whether the rates in the variants are statistically different, we can use the **chi-squared test**, which is a statistical test for categorical variables. Data for a chi-squared test is often shown in the form of a contingency table, which shows the frequency of observations at the intersection of two attributes. This looks just like a pivot table to those who are familiar with that type of table.\n",

Examples include amount spent by customers, time spent on page, and days an app is used. Ecommerce sites often want to increase sales, and so they might experiment on product pages or checkout flows. Content sites may test layout, navigation, and head‐ lines to try to increase the number of stories read. A company running an app might run a remarketing campaign to remind users to come back to the app.\n",

    "The average for the control group is statistically significantly higher than that for variant 1 at a 95% confidence interval. This result may seem perplexing, but it illustrates why it is so important to agree on the success metric for an experiment up front. The experiment variant 1 had a positive effect on onboarding completion and so can be judged a success. It did not have an effect on the overall spending level. This could be due to a mix shift: the additional users who made it through onboarding in variant 1 were less likely to pay. If the underlying hypothesis was that increasing onboarding completion rates would increase revenue, then the experiment should not be judged a success, and the product managers should come up with some new ideas to test."
